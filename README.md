#**LIRI Bot**

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

There are currently four commands that may be given:
*"spotify-this song" - Displays the artist, song name, preview to the link, and the album
*"movie-this" - displays the title, year of release, IMDB rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating, country of origin, language of the movie, plot, and cast
*"concert-this" - Displays the name of the venue, location, and date of event
*"do-what-it-says" - Runs a command from the random.txt file
